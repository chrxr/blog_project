24	2016-11-14	When employing a digital agency on a project, you can save time and money with a little pre-project preparation	[{"type": "paragraph", "value": "<p>Having been a project manager on both the agency and client side of big website builds, I've found that the smoothest projects and best agency client relationships are a result of good preparation on the client side. Here are five simple ways to get your relationship with your agency off to the best possible start.</p><h3>1 - Establish clear lines of communications</h3><p>Of any of these suggestions, turning around agency queries quickly, with clear decisions, can have the most direct, and positive impact on the overall cost of your project.</p><p>There should be one main point of contact in your organisation who will liaise directly with the project manager at your digital agency. That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app. Usually this person will be the project manager on the business side. If this is you, make sure the limits of your authority are clearly defined with senior stakeholder in your business.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>2 - Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service. I've seen projects spend thousands of pounds on design work only to find, once the branding guidelines were finally delivered, that almost of all of the work had to be redone. Avoid this at all costs! Find the guidelines and hand them over.</p><h3>3 - Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses. Hold one-to-one\\u00a0meetings\\u00a0with the top-stakeholders\\u00a0at the beginning of the process\\u00a0to make them feel like their ideas and concerns are being taken into consideration. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. Don't over-promise though. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>4 - What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know\\u00a0the concrete results that you want to see from your project. Business objectives are the start of that.\\u00a0You can save quite a bit of time and discussion with your agency by being able to provide these business objectives for the project up-front. Discussing these internally will also generate buy-in for your project.<br/></p><p>A good agency will subject these initial objectives to scrutiny, and you should be willing to accept change if strong arguments are made. However, the act of compiling these objectives will allow you to focus on the most important desired benefits that you want to get out of a project.</p><p>Sometimes, projects can seem large and abstract, making it hard to focus down your objectives to a manageable list. For example, with a website design, it can often feel like just finishing the project is success enough in itself. I mean, you've got a whole brand new website, right? But this mentality can lead to loosing track of the things that really matter for your business and your site visitors, like usability, search engine and speed optimisation, and conversion rates.</p><p>A great tool to help you develop your business objectives and related key performance indicators (KPIs) is the <a href=\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-marketing-and-measurement-model/\\">Digital Marketing and Measurement Model</a>, created by digital marketing and analytics guru, Avinash Kaushik. Read this, follow his instructions, and you'll end up with objectives and KPIs ready to hand straight over to your agency.</p><p></p><h3>5 - Start capturing data as soon as possible</h3><p>Tracking the performance of a new website or app against existing solutions will be very difficult if you have no data on how your existing solutions are performing. Collecting this data should be a top priority.</p><p>Historical data will allow your agency to see how much course correction is required to meet your business objectives. For a website redesign or build, make sure you have analytics installed on your current site, and start tracking performance (new users, session times, goal conversion rates etc) against your KPIs in a spreadsheet.Your agency project manager's eyes will light up when you hand this over to them at the beginning of the project.</p>"}]	\N		\N	<p>When employing a digital agency on a project, you can save time and money with a little pre-project preparation</p>

23	2016-08-27	\N	[{"value": "<p>I&#x27;d been thinking about using SolrCloud for a project at work recently, and I wanted to test it out locally. To do this I used <a href=\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/\\">Vagrant</a> to setup a multi-machine private network with static IPs.</p><p>Getting the machines setup was much easier than I expected, and then getting SolrCloud working wasn&#x27;t much more complicated. However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I&#x27;m going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>I used OSX to create this setup, but it should also work on major Linux distributions. I&#x27;m not a Windows user so you&#x27;ll have to do your own research if that&#x27;s what you need.</p><p>You will need <a href=\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.virtualbox.org\\">VirtualBox</a> installed on your host machine.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The &#x27;Cloud&#x27; part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy. Queries arrive at one of the nodes and the query is then forwarded to the node where a replica of the appropriate shard is located.</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I&#x27;m going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>Our aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own virtual machine. Our setup will have three Solr nodes with which we can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. We could have multiple Zookeeper instances to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we&#x27;re going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that we can split our data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down we&#x27;ll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>Our test network will be built using Ubuntu virtual machines. The first thing we&#x27;re going to do is create a new directory for our test VMs on our host machine, and then generate a Vagrant file including the Ubuntu Trusty64 Vagrant box.</p>", "type": "paragraph", "id": "1ebd142a-84f7-4091-b466-a2a5f35d7e5b"}, {"value": {"language": "bash", "code": "mkdir -p ~/solrcloud-test\\r\\ncd ~/solrcloud-test\\r\\nvagrant init ubuntu/trusty64"}, "type": "real_codeblock", "id": "56c7cf60-a22a-4f40-8bcc-a80ed71895fb"}, {"value": "This will generate a file called `Vagrantfile` which includes the instructions for Vagrant to build a basic Ubuntu VM.

26	2019-06-27	Over the last two years, I’ve been working with Harvard SEAS faculty and cloud providers to determine how we can best facilitate students use of cloud technologies in the classroom.	[{"value": "<p></p><p>Over this time I have found that there are a few principles that cloud providers (e.g. AWS and GCP) who are hoping to penetrate the higher education market would do well to adhere to.</p><p>If cloud providers follow these principles when developing their tools and services for educational use then I believe they have a much greater chance of being adopted in the classroom.</p><h2><b>Most CS courses teach concepts, not tools</b></h2><p>The aim of most courses that utilize the cloud is not to teach the use of a particular tool or platform, but to teach a computing concept and to demonstrate its application.</p><p>When teaching these concepts, teaching time is invaluable. If you spend 2 weeks trying to make sure everybody in a class has an account and basic knowledge of how to use your platform, then that time is lost and cannot be made up.</p><p>For this reason, onboarding for the tool should be as seamless as possible. There should be a very clear pathway for students to learn how to navigate your platform. A dedicated set of short videos aimed at students that could be assigned as a homework 0 task would be ideal.</p><h2><b>It must be easy for TFs and other teaching staff to support their students</b></h2><p>Consider integrations with common LMS platforms to simplify adding students to resources and easily enable SSO.</p><p>Provide an administrative interface from which teaching staff can monitor students\\u2019 spend.</p><h2><b>Be generous with the amount of credit provided to each student.</b></h2><p>Every semester we see students using advanced, CPU and memory intensive operations earlier and earlier in their academic journey.</p><p>Many entry level tasks these days involve GPUs which cost upwards of 1$ per hour. It is not unreasonable to expect a student to use 200 - 300 hours of GPU time over a 4 month course. So, credit limits should be flexible.</p><p>It should be very easy for teaching staff, or even students themselves, to extend their credit limit if necessary.</p><h2><b>Students should never be charged</b></h2><p>I personally believe that asking students to sign-up with a credit card is potentially discriminatory.</p><p>In the past, we have seen students overspend on their accounts (for example, by leaving a GPU running, unused). This has led to many hours of teaching staff negotiating on their behalf to have bills cancelled. Making it as easy as possible for students and teaching staff to monitor student spend would help here.</p><p>Tools should also enable limiting the resources that a student can use, but these limits should be flexible or customizable.</p>", "type": "paragraph", "id": "9ff852dd-1f32-41f8-9664-7e560501ac8b"}]	\N	\N	\N	<p></p>

I use Evernote ALL THE TIME. It's an essential tool for me. So I thought, how can I use the tool that I already use to help me organise my time.<br/></p><p>The key was to format it in an appropriate way. At the top of my list I have the 'week beginning' date. Then I have my current list of to-dos, ordered roughly by priority. I add EVERYTHING work-related that I have to do that is a discrete task, even small tasks. If I do something work-related that's not on the to-do list, I add it to the list. I use the checkbox list type, as it soothes my OCD side to see each box ticked off. Once a task has been ticked off, I copy and paste it into another list below the main list, which has today's date as the heading. So as the days go by you end up with an archive of your completed tasks for each individual day.</p><p>Visibility of the list is key. One of the biggest pains in trying to use a specific tool was that it was one more thing to have open on the screen. With Evernote, I just add it to my 'Shortcuts' list. Then it's always there in the top-left of Evernote, a tool that I would have open all the time anyway!</p><p><embed alt=\\\\\\"Lunchtime_reads.png\\\\\\" embedtype=\\\\\\"image\\\\\\" format=\\\\\\"fullwidth\\\\\\" id=\\\\\\"2\\\\\\"/><br/></p><p>At the end of the month, I'll archive that particular note in a separate notebook, take it out of my shortcuts, and create a new to-do note for the month.</p><p>I've now started to expand the format to include other types of to-dos. I often review relevant newsletters and blogs for content as soon as I get into work, but then I like to actually read them over lunch. So I've created a 'Lunchtime reading' list, again with tick-boxes, and a 'Reading archive' at the bottom of the to-do note.</p><p><embed alt=\\\\\\"Tasks_and_archive.png\\\\\\" embedtype=\\\\\\"image\\\\\\" format=\\\\\\"fullwidth\\\\\\" id=\\\\\\"3\\\\\\"/><br/></p><p>Anyway, it's a very simple solution, that appeals to me for it's 'Collect the completed tasks!' nature.</p>\\"}]", "numchild": 0, "listing_image": null, "content_type": 27, "show_in_menus": false, "date": "2015-12-07", "path": "000100010007", "url_path": "/home/using-evernote-do-list/", "expired": false, "pk": 14, "main_image": null, "locked": false, "depth": 3, "first_published_at": "2015-12-15T22:15:02.212Z", "expire_at": null}	\N	14	1

That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app. Usually this person will be the project manager on the business side. If this is you, make sure the limits of your authority are clearly defined with senior stakeholder in your business.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>2 - Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service. I've seen projects spend thousands of pounds on design work only to find, once the branding guidelines were finally delivered, that almost of all of the work had to be redone. Avoid this at all costs! Find the guidelines and hand them over.</p><h3>3 - Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses.

Here are my five most important:</p><h3>1 - Establish clear lines of communications</h3><p>Of any of these suggestions, turning around agency queries quickly, with clear decisions, can have the most direct, and positive impact on the overall cost of your project.</p><p>There should be one main point of contact in your organisation who will liaise directly with the project manager at your digital agency. That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app. Usually this person will be the project manager on the business side. If this is you, make sure the limits of your authority are clearly defined with senior stakeholder in your business.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>2 - Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service. I've seen projects spend thousands of pounds on design work only to find, once the branding guidelines were finally delivered, that almost of all of the work had to be redone. Avoid this at all costs! Find the guidelines and hand them over.</p><h3>3 - Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses. Hold one-to-one\\\\u00a0meetings\\\\u00a0with the top-stakeholders\\\\u00a0at the beginning of the process\\\\u00a0to make them feel like their ideas and concerns are being taken into consideration. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. Don't over-promise though. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>4 - What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know\\\\u00a0the concrete results that you want to see from your project.

Then I have my current list of to-dos, ordered roughly by priority. I add EVERYTHING work-related that I have to do that is a discrete task, even small tasks. If I do something work-related that's not on the to-do list, I add it to the list. I use the checkbox list type, as it soothes my OCD side to see each box ticked off.

That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app. Usually this person will be the project manager on the business side. If this is you, make sure the limits of your authority are clearly defined with senior stakeholder in your business.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>2 - Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service. I've seen projects spend thousands of pounds on design work only to find, once the branding guidelines were finally delivered, that almost of all of the work had to be redone. Avoid this at all costs! Find the guidelines and hand them over.</p><h3>3 - Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses. Hold one-to-one\\\\u00a0meetings\\\\u00a0with the top-stakeholders\\\\u00a0at the beginning of the process\\\\u00a0to make them feel like their ideas and concerns are being taken into consideration. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. Don't over-promise though. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>4 - What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know\\\\u00a0the concrete results that you want to see from your project. Business objectives are the start of that.\\\\u00a0You can save quite a bit of time and discussion with your agency by being able to provide these business objectives for the project up-front. Discussing these internally will also generate buy-in for your project.<br/></p><p>A good agency will subject these initial objectives to scrutiny, and you should be willing to accept change if strong arguments are made. However, the act of compiling these objectives will allow you to focus on the most important desired benefits that you want to get out of a project.</p><p>Sometimes, projects can seem large and abstract, making it hard to focus down your objectives to a manageable list. For example, with a website design, it can often feel like just finishing the project is success enough in itself. I mean, you've got a whole brand new website, right? But this mentality can lead to loosing track of the things that really matter for your business and your site visitors, like usability, search engine and speed optimisation, and conversion rates.</p><p>A great tool to help you develop your business objectives and related key performance indicators (KPIs) is the <a href=\\\\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-marketing-and-measurement-model/\\\\\\">Digital Marketing and Measurement Model</a>, created by digital marketing and analytics guru, Avinash Kaushik. Read this, follow his instructions, and you'll end up with objectives and KPIs ready to hand straight over to your agency.</p><p></p><h3>5 - Start capturing data as soon as possible</h3><p>Tracking the performance of a new website or app against existing solutions will be very difficult if you have no data on how your existing solutions are performing. Collecting this data should be a top priority.</p><p>Historical data will allow your agency to see how much course correction is required to meet your business objectives. For a website redesign or build, make sure you have analytics installed on your current site, and start tracking performance (new users, session times, goal conversion rates etc) against your KPIs in a spreadsheet.Your agency project manager's eyes will light up when you hand this over to them at the beginning of the project.</p>\\"}]", "numchild": 0, "listing_image": null, "content_type": 27, "show_in_menus": false, "date": "2016-11-14", "path": "00010001000H", "url_path": "/home/5-ways-get-best-out-your-digital-agency/", "expired": false, "pk": 24, "main_image": null, "locked": false, "depth": 3, "first_published_at": null, "expire_at": null}	\N	24	1

Here are my five most important:</p><h3>1 - Establish clear lines of communications</h3><p>Of any of these suggestions, turning around agency queries quickly, with clear decisions, can have the most direct, and positive impact on the overall cost of your project.</p><p>There should be one main point of contact in your organisation who will liaise directly with the project manager at your digital agency. That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app. Usually this person will be the project manager on the business side. If this is you, make sure the limits of your authority are clearly defined with senior stakeholder in your business.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>2 - Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service. I've seen projects spend thousands of pounds on design work only to find, once the branding guidelines were finally delivered, that almost of all of the work had to be redone. Avoid this at all costs! Find the guidelines and hand them over.</p><h3>3 - Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses. Hold one-to-one\\\\u00a0meetings\\\\u00a0with the top-stakeholders\\\\u00a0at the beginning of the process\\\\u00a0to make them feel like their ideas and concerns are being taken into consideration. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. Don't over-promise though. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>4 - What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know\\\\u00a0the concrete results that you want to see from your project. Business objectives are the start of that.\\\\u00a0You can save quite a bit of time and discussion with your agency by being able to provide these business objectives for the project up-front. Discussing these internally will also generate buy-in for your project.<br/></p><p>A good agency will subject these initial objectives to scrutiny, and you should be willing to accept change if strong arguments are made. However, the act of compiling these objectives will allow you to focus on the most important desired benefits that you want to get out of a project.</p><p>Sometimes, projects can seem large and abstract, making it hard to focus down your objectives to a manageable list. For example, with a website design, it can often feel like just finishing the project is success enough in itself. I mean, you've got a whole brand new website, right? But this mentality can lead to loosing track of the things that really matter for your business and your site visitors, like usability, search engine and speed optimisation, and conversion rates.</p><p>A great tool to help you develop your business objectives and related key performance indicators (KPIs) is the <a href=\\\\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-marketing-and-measurement-model/\\\\\\">Digital Marketing and Measurement Model</a>, created by digital marketing and analytics guru, Avinash Kaushik. Read this, follow his instructions, and you'll end up with objectives and KPIs ready to hand straight over to your agency.</p><p></p><h3>5 - Start capturing data as soon as possible</h3><p>Tracking the performance of a new website or app against existing solutions will be very difficult if you have no data on how your existing solutions are performing. Collecting this data should be a top priority.</p><p>Historical data will allow your agency to see how much course correction is required to meet your business objectives. For a website redesign or build, make sure you have analytics installed on your current site, and start tracking performance (new users, session times, goal conversion rates etc) against your KPIs in a spreadsheet.Your agency project manager's eyes will light up when you hand this over to them at the beginning of the project.</p>\\"}]", "numchild": 0, "listing_image": null, "content_type": 27, "show_in_menus": false, "date": "2016-11-14", "path": "00010001000H", "url_path": "/home/5-ways-get-best-out-your-digital-agency/", "expired": false, "pk": 24, "main_image": null, "locked": false, "depth": 3, "first_published_at": null, "expire_at": null}	\N	24	1

Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy. Queries arrive at one of the nodes and the query is then forwarded to the node where a replica of the appropriate shard is located.\\\\u00a0</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p></p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>Our aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own virtual machine. Our setup will have three Solr nodes with which we can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. We could have multiple Zookeeper instances to provide further redundancy.

I use Evernote ALL THE TIME. It's an essential tool for me. So I thought, how can I use the tool that I already use to help me organise my time.<br/></p><p>The key was to format it in an appropriate way. At the top of my list I have the 'week beginning' date. Then I have my current list of to-dos, ordered roughly by priority. I add EVERYTHING work-related that I have to do that is a discrete task, even small tasks. If I do something work-related that's not on the to-do list, I add it to the list. I use the checkbox list type, as it soothes my OCD side to see each box ticked off. Once a task has been ticked off, I copy and paste it into another list below the main list, which has today's date as the heading. So as the days go by you end up with an archive of your completed tasks for each individual day.</p><p>Visibility of the list is key. One of the biggest pains in trying to use a specific tool was that it was one more thing to have open on the screen. With Evernote, I just add it to my 'Shortcuts' list. Then it's always there in the top-left of Evernote, a tool that I would have open all the time anyway!</p><p><embed alt=\\\\\\"Lunchtime_reads.png\\\\\\" embedtype=\\\\\\"image\\\\\\" format=\\\\\\"fullwidth\\\\\\" id=\\\\\\"2\\\\\\"/><br/></p><p>At the end of the month, I'll archive that particular note in a separate notebook, take it out of my shortcuts, and create a new to-do note for the month.</p><p>I've now started to expand the format to include other types of to-dos. I often review relevant newsletters and blogs for content as soon as I get into work, but then I like to actually read them over lunch. So I've created a 'Lunchtime reading' list, again with tick-boxes, and a 'Reading archive' at the bottom of the to-do note.</p><p><embed alt=\\\\\\"Tasks_and_archive.png\\\\\\" embedtype=\\\\\\"image\\\\\\" format=\\\\\\"fullwidth\\\\\\" id=\\\\\\"3\\\\\\"/><br/></p><p>Anyway, it's a very simple solution, that appeals to me for it's 'Collect the completed tasks!' nature.</p>\\"}]", "numchild": 0, "listing_image": null, "content_type": 27, "show_in_menus": false, "date": "2015-12-14", "path": "000100010007", "url_path": "/home/using-evernote-as-a-to-do-list/", "expired": false, "pk": 14, "main_image": null, "locked": false, "depth": 3, "first_published_at": "2015-12-15T22:15:02.212Z", "expire_at": null}	\N	14	1

Here are my five most important:</p><h3>1 - Establish clear lines of communications</h3><p>Of any of these suggestions, turning around agency queries quickly, with clear decisions, can have the most direct, and positive impact on the overall cost of your project.</p><p>There should be one main point of contact in your organisation who will liaise directly with the project manager at your digital agency. That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app. Usually this person will be the project manager on the business side. If this is you, make sure the limits of your authority are clearly defined with senior stakeholder in your business.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>2 - Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service. I've seen projects spend thousands of pounds on design work only to find, once the branding guidelines were finally delivered, that almost of all of the work had to be redone. Avoid this at all costs! Find the guidelines and hand them over.</p><h3>3 - Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses. Hold one-to-one\\\\u00a0meetings\\\\u00a0with the top-stakeholders\\\\u00a0at the beginning of the process\\\\u00a0to make them feel like their ideas and concerns are being taken into consideration. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. Don't over-promise though. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>4 - What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know\\\\u00a0the concrete results that you want to see from your project. Business objectives are the start of that.\\\\u00a0You can save quite a bit of time and discussion with your agency by being able to provide these business objectives for the project up-front. Discussing these internally will also generate buy-in for your project.<br/></p><p>A good agency will subject these initial objectives to scrutiny, and you should be willing to accept change if strong arguments are made. However, the act of compiling these objectives will allow you to focus on the most important desired benefits that you want to get out of a project.</p><p>Sometimes, projects can seem large and abstract, making it hard to focus down your objectives to a manageable list. For example, with a website design, it can often feel like just finishing the project is success enough in itself. I mean, you've got a whole brand new website, right? But this mentality can lead to loosing track of the things that really matter for your business and your site visitors, like usability, search engine and speed optimisation, and conversion rates.</p><p>A great tool to help you develop your business objectives and related key performance indicators (KPIs) is the <a href=\\\\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-marketing-and-measurement-model/\\\\\\">Digital Marketing and Measurement Model</a>, created by digital marketing and analytics guru, Avinash Kaushik. Read this, follow his instructions, and you'll end up with objectives and KPIs ready to hand straight over to your agency.</p><p></p><h3>5 - Start capturing data as soon as possible</h3><p>Tracking the performance of a new website or app against existing solutions will be very difficult if you have no data on how your existing solutions are performing. Collecting this data should be a top priority.</p><p>Historical data will allow your agency to see how much course correction is required to meet your business objectives. For a website redesign or build, make sure you have analytics installed on your current site, and start tracking performance (new users, session times, goal conversion rates etc) against your KPIs in a spreadsheet.Your agency project manager's eyes will light up when you hand this over to them at the beginning of the project.</p>\\"}]", "numchild": 0, "listing_image": null, "content_type": 27, "show_in_menus": false, "date": "2016-11-14", "path": "00010001000H", "url_path": "/home/5-ways-get-best-out-your-digital-agency/", "expired": false, "pk": 24, "main_image": null, "locked": false, "depth": 3, "first_published_at": null, "expire_at": null}	\N	24	1

That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app. Usually this person will be the project manager on the business side. If this is you, make sure the limits of your authority are clearly defined with senior stakeholder in your business.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>2 - Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service. I've seen projects spend thousands of pounds on design work only to find, once the branding guidelines were finally delivered, that almost of all of the work had to be redone. Avoid this at all costs! Find the guidelines and hand them over.</p><h3>3 - Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses. Hold one-to-one\\\\u00a0meetings\\\\u00a0with the top-stakeholders\\\\u00a0at the beginning of the process\\\\u00a0to make them feel like their ideas and concerns are being taken into consideration. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. Don't over-promise though. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>4 - What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know\\\\u00a0the concrete results that you want to see from your project. Business objectives are the start of that.\\\\u00a0You can save quite a bit of time and discussion with your agency by being able to provide these business objectives for the project up-front. Discussing these internally will also generate buy-in for your project.<br/></p><p>A good agency will subject these initial objectives to scrutiny, and you should be willing to accept change if strong arguments are made. However, the act of compiling these objectives will allow you to focus on the most important desired benefits that you want to get out of a project.</p><p>Sometimes, projects can seem large and abstract, making it hard to focus down your objectives to a manageable list. For example, with a website design, it can often feel like just finishing the project is success enough in itself. I mean, you've got a whole brand new website, right? But this mentality can lead to loosing track of the things that really matter for your business and your site visitors, like usability, search engine and speed optimisation, and conversion rates.</p><p>A great tool to help you develop your business objectives and related key performance indicators (KPIs) is the <a href=\\\\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-marketing-and-measurement-model/\\\\\\">Digital Marketing and Measurement Model</a>, created by digital marketing and analytics guru, Avinash Kaushik. Read this, follow his instructions, and you'll end up with objectives and KPIs ready to hand straight over to your agency.</p><p></p><h3>5 - Start capturing data as soon as possible</h3><p>Tracking the performance of a new website or app against existing solutions will be very difficult if you have no data on how your existing solutions are performing. Collecting this data should be a top priority.</p><p>Historical data will allow your agency to see how much course correction is required to meet your business objectives. For a website redesign or build, make sure you have analytics installed on your current site, and start tracking performance (new users, session times, goal conversion rates etc) against your KPIs in a spreadsheet.Your agency project manager's eyes will light up when you hand this over to them at the beginning of the project.</p>\\"}]", "numchild": 0, "listing_image": null, "content_type": 27, "show_in_menus": false, "date": "2016-11-14", "path": "00010001000H", "url_path": "/home/5-ways-get-best-out-your-digital-agency/", "expired": false, "pk": 24, "main_image": null, "locked": false, "depth": 3, "first_published_at": "2016-11-14T19:44:46.341Z", "expire_at": null}	\N	24	1

However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I'm going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>I used OSX to create this setup, but it should also work on major Linux distros. I'm not a Windows user so you'll have to do your own research if that's what you need.</p><p>You will need <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.virtualbox.org\\\\\\">VirtualBox</a> installed on your host machine.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><p></p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The 'Cloud' part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy.\\\\u00a0</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p></p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>My aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own machine. My setup will have three Solr nodes with which I can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. You could have multiple Zookeeper instance to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\\\\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we're going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that I can split my data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down I'll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>I'm building my test network using Ubuntu virtual machines.

I don't think, though, it is the job of the designer or the developer to find these out for themselves.</p><h2>Step 0: What are the business objectives?</h2><p>A project cannot hope to fully succeed without some kind of influence and direction from the company / client's business objectives. \\\\u00a0Often I've found in projects that some of the business objectives are obvious, and so make their way into the project without explicitly having to discover or define them. For example, a campaigning charity would want to communicate their campaign messages effectively and elicit donations. But their are nuances and priorities that are almost always missed when business objectives are not explicitly defined with the client.</p><h4>Good example:</h4><p></p><ul><li>Project begins with discussions regarding KPIs</li><li>Quickly uncover a lack of quality business objectives</li><li>Client confers with management to define objectives, resulting in buy-in from management and a clear direction for the project</li><li>This is communicated effectively to UX specialist, designers and developers, so everyone is working from the same playbook.</li></ul><h4>Bad example:</h4><p></p><ul><li>Project begins with assumed business objectives</li><li>KPIs are based on these</li><li>Not adequately communicated with the rest of team</li><li>Design direction starts off on the wrong path and continues to diverge away from goals</li><li>Client unhappy, more money needs to be spent on course correction.</li><li>Sad faces all round</li></ul><h2>How do you work out business objectives?</h2><p><ul><li>Existing documentation</li><li>Talk to the bosses (+ gets buy-in)</li><li>Specific exercises to draw out business objectives if they are not yet formally documented</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p>\\"}]", "numchild": 0, "listing_image": null, "content_type": 27, "show_in_menus": false, "date": "2016-03-01", "path": "00010001000B", "url_path": "/home/pms-know-your-business-objectives/", "expired": false, "pk": 18, "main_image": null, "locked": false, "depth": 3, "first_published_at": null, "expire_at": null}	\N	18	1

Here are five simple ways to get your relationship with your agency off to the best possible start.</p><h3>1 - Establish clear lines of communications</h3><p>Of any of these suggestions, turning around agency queries quickly, with clear decisions, can have the most direct, and positive impact on the overall cost of your project.</p><p>There should be one main point of contact in your organisation who will liaise directly with the project manager at your digital agency. That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app. Usually this person will be the project manager on the business side. If this is you, make sure the limits of your authority are clearly defined with senior stakeholder in your business.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>2 - Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service. I've seen projects spend thousands of pounds on design work only to find, once the branding guidelines were finally delivered, that almost of all of the work had to be redone. Avoid this at all costs! Find the guidelines and hand them over.</p><h3>3 - Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses. Hold one-to-one\\\\u00a0meetings\\\\u00a0with the top-stakeholders\\\\u00a0at the beginning of the process\\\\u00a0to make them feel like their ideas and concerns are being taken into consideration. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. Don't over-promise though. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>4 - What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know\\\\u00a0the concrete results that you want to see from your project. Business objectives are the start of that.\\\\u00a0You can save quite a bit of time and discussion with your agency by being able to provide these business objectives for the project up-front. Discussing these internally will also generate buy-in for your project.<br/></p><p>A good agency will subject these initial objectives to scrutiny, and you should be willing to accept change if strong arguments are made. However, the act of compiling these objectives will allow you to focus on the most important desired benefits that you want to get out of a project.</p><p>Sometimes, projects can seem large and abstract, making it hard to focus down your objectives to a manageable list. For example, with a website design, it can often feel like just finishing the project is success enough in itself. I mean, you've got a whole brand new website, right? But this mentality can lead to loosing track of the things that really matter for your business and your site visitors, like usability, search engine and speed optimisation, and conversion rates.</p><p>A great tool to help you develop your business objectives and related key performance indicators (KPIs) is the <a href=\\\\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-marketing-and-measurement-model/\\\\\\">Digital Marketing and Measurement Model</a>, created by digital marketing and analytics guru, Avinash Kaushik. Read this, follow his instructions, and you'll end up with objectives and KPIs ready to hand straight over to your agency.</p><p></p><h3>5 - Start capturing data as soon as possible</h3><p>Tracking the performance of a new website or app against existing solutions will be very difficult if you have no data on how your existing solutions are performing.

To do this I used <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> to setup a multi-machine private network with static IPs.</p><p>Getting the machines setup was much easier than I expected, and then getting SolrCloud working wasn't much more complicated. However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I'm going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><p></p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The 'Cloud' part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy.\\\\u00a0</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p></p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>My aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own machine. My setup will have three Solr nodes with which I can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. You could have multiple Zookeeper instance to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\\\\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we're going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that I can split my data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down I'll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>I'm building my test network using Ubuntu virtual machines.

So as the days go by you end up with an archive of your completed tasks for each individual day.</p><p>Visibility of the list is key. One of the biggest pains in trying to use a specific tool was that it was one more thing to have open on the screen. With Evernote, I just add it to my 'Shortcuts' list.

Hold one-to-one meetings at the beginning of the process. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>What are the concrete results that you want to see from your project? You can save quite a bit of time and discussion with your agency by being able to provide these business objectives for the project up-front. A good agency will subject these to scrutiny, and you should be willing to accept change if strong arguments are made. However, the act of compiling these objectives will allow you to focus on the most important desired benefits that you want to get out of a project.</p><p>Sometimes, projects can seem large and abstract, making it hard to focus down your objectives to a manageable list. For example, with a website design, it can often feel like just finishing the project is success enough in itself. I mean, you've got a whole brand new website, right? But this mentality can lead to loosing track of the things that really matter for your business, and your site visitors, like usability, search engine and speed optimisation, and conversion rates.</p><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know what you want from the project. Business objectives are the start of that. From there you can develop key performance indicators (KPIs) based on these business objectives. Once you've got KPIs, you'll know what to track to ensure you're meeting your business objectives!</p><p><h3>Start tracking things as soon as possible</h3><p>Once you have those KPIs, you should start tracking your current performance against them as soon as possible. Historical data will allow your agency to see how much course correction is required to meet your business objectives. For a website redesign or build, make sure you have analytics installed on your current site, and start tracking performance (new users, session times, goal conversion rates etc) against your KPIs in a spreadsheet.Your agency project manager's eyes will light up when you hand this over to them at the beginning of the project.</p><p>This information will help your agency make better decisions about the design and build of your new website. These better decisions mean you are more likely to meet your company's business objectives. From a cost saving perspective, having clear objectives will help your agency get things right first time.

By doing these things you can make the your life easier, their life easier, and save a bunch of money as well.</p><h3>Establish clear lines of communications</h3><p>Turning around agency queries quickly with clear decisions can have the biggest direct, positive impact on the overall cost of your project of any of these suggestions.</p><p>There should be one main point of contact in your organisation, who will liaise directly with the project manager at your digital agency. That person should have the power to make at least reasonably important decisions. For example, that person should be able to make a call on a design query for a website, or on the detailed functionality of a feature of an app.</p><p>When it comes to big decisions that need wider consultation within your business, you should have a clearly defined route for getting these decisions made. Perhaps you have a weekly meeting with a project board, where agency queries could be a standing agenda item.</p><p>For big, complicated projects, you might need multiple points of contacts, each responsible for a specific feature or area of the project. Each of these people should have decision making powers over their area. They will also need to communicate with each other very regularly, to make sure that they aren't sending mixed messages back to the agency. This should be avoided at all costs, as confusion on the agency side will lead to higher costs. Stick to one point of contact if at all possible.</p><h3>Come prepared with buy-in from the top</h3><p>Getting buy-in from the senior execs in a business from the outset can only help smooth the communication process as the project progresses. Hold one-to-one meetings at the beginning of the process. Try to get them excited about the results your project could deliver, and discuss what they think should be the priority goals for the project. This is also a good time to discuss business objectives.</p><h3>What are your business objectives for the project?</h3><p>What are the concrete results that you want to see from your project? You can save quite a bit of time and discussion with your agency by being able to provide these business objectives for the project up-front. A good agency will subject these to scrutiny, and you should be willing to accept change if strong arguments are made. However, the act of compiling these objectives will allow you to focus on the most important desired benefits that you want to get out of a project.</p><p>Sometimes, projects can seem large and abstract, making it hard to focus down your objectives to a manageable list. For example, with a website design, it can often feel like just finishing the project is success enough in itself. I mean, you've got a whole brand new website, right? But this mentality can lead to loosing track of the things that really matter for your business, and your site visitors, like usability, search engine and speed optimisation, and conversion rates.</p><p>Your agency should help you through the process of discovering who your users are, and what exactly they need, but before they can do that, they'll need to know what you want from the project. Business objectives are the start of that. From there you can develop key performance indicators (KPIs) based on these business objectives. Once you've got KPIs, you'll know what to track to ensure you're meeting your business objectives!</p><p></p><h3>Start tracking KPIs as soon as possible</h3><p>Once you have those KPIs, you should start tracking your current performance against them as soon as possible. Historical data will allow your agency to see how much course correction is required to meet your business objectives. For a website redesign or build, make sure you have analytics installed on your current site, and start tracking performance (new users, session times, goal conversion rates etc) against your KPIs in a spreadsheet.Your agency project manager's eyes will light up when you hand this over to them at the beginning of the project.</p><p>This information will help your agency make better decisions about the design and build of your new website. These better decisions mean you are more likely to meet your company's business objectives. From a cost saving perspective, having clear objectives will help your agency get things right first time. Every time you need to go back and change something, the project budget gets lower and lower.</p><h3>Got brand guidelines? Hand'em over!</h3><p>If your project involves design of any kind, make sure your agency has your branding guidelines as soon as possible. If you don't have a company endorsed, branding guidelines document, don't worry, your agency should help you to define what you expect from the design element of your project, and this can be based on your existing corporate identity as necessary.</p><p>Branding guidelines are often very expensive documents to but together. If your company has one, then you'll almost certainly be expected to at least pay it lip-service.

To do this I used <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> to setup a multi-machine private network with static IPs.</p><p>Getting the machines setup was much easier than I expected, and then getting SolrCloud working wasn't much more complicated. However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I'm going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>I used OSX to create this setup, but it should also work on major Linux distros. I'm not a Windows user so you'll have to do your own research if that's what you need.</p><p>You will need <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.virtualbox.org\\\\\\">VirtualBox</a> installed on your host machine.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><p></p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The 'Cloud' part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy.\\\\u00a0</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p></p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>My aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own machine. My setup will have three Solr nodes with which I can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. You could have multiple Zookeeper instance to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\\\\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we're going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that I can split my data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down I'll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>I'm building my test network using Ubuntu virtual machines.

However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I'm going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>I used OSX to create this setup, but it should also work on major Linux distros. I'm not a Windows user so you'll have to do your own research if that's what you need.</p><p>You will need <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.virtualbox.org\\\\\\">VirtualBox</a> installed on your host machine.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><p></p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The 'Cloud' part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes.

My setup will have three Solr nodes with which I can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. You could have multiple Zookeeper instance to provide further redundancy.

To do this I used <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> to setup a multi-machine private network with static IPs.</p><p>Getting the machines setup was much easier than I expected, and then getting SolrCloud working wasn't much more complicated. However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I'm going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>I used OSX to create this setup, but it should also work on major Linux distros. I'm not a Windows user so you'll have to do your own research if that's what you need.</p><p>You will need <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.virtualbox.org\\\\\\">VirtualBox</a> installed on your host machine.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><p></p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The 'Cloud' part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy.\\\\u00a0</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p></p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>My aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own machine. My setup will have three Solr nodes with which I can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. You could have multiple Zookeeper instance to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\\\\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we're going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that I can split my data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down I'll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>I'm building my test network using Ubuntu virtual machines.

To do this I used <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> to setup a multi-machine private network with static IPs.</p><p>Getting the machines setup was much easier than I expected, and then getting SolrCloud working wasn't much more complicated. However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I'm going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><p></p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The 'Cloud' part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy.\\\\u00a0</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p></p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>My aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own machine. My setup will have three Solr nodes with which I can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. You could have multiple Zookeeper instance to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\\\\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we're going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that I can split my data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down I'll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>I'm building my test network using Ubuntu virtual machines.

However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I&#x27;m going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>I used OSX to create this setup, but it should also work on major Linux distributions. I&#x27;m not a Windows user so you&#x27;ll have to do your own research if that&#x27;s what you need.</p><p>You will need <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.virtualbox.org\\\\\\">VirtualBox</a> installed on your host machine.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The &#x27;Cloud&#x27; part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy. Queries arrive at one of the nodes and the query is then forwarded to the node where a replica of the appropriate shard is located.</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I&#x27;m going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>Our aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own virtual machine. Our setup will have three Solr nodes with which we can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. We could have multiple Zookeeper instances to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\\\\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we&#x27;re going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that we can split our data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down we&#x27;ll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>Our test network will be built using Ubuntu virtual machines.

To do this I used <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> to setup a multi-machine private network with static IPs.</p><p>Getting the machines setup was much easier than I expected, and then getting SolrCloud working wasn&#x27;t much more complicated. However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I&#x27;m going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>I used OSX to create this setup, but it should also work on major Linux distributions. I&#x27;m not a Windows user so you&#x27;ll have to do your own research if that&#x27;s what you need.</p><p>You will need <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.virtualbox.org\\\\\\">VirtualBox</a> installed on your host machine.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><p></p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The &#x27;Cloud&#x27; part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy. Queries arrive at one of the nodes and the query is then forwarded to the node where a replica of the appropriate shard is located.</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p></p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I&#x27;m going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>Our aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own virtual machine. Our setup will have three Solr nodes with which we can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. We could have multiple Zookeeper instances to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\\\\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we&#x27;re going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that we can split our data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down we&#x27;ll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>Our test network will be built using Ubuntu virtual machines.

To do this I used <a href=\\\\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/\\\\\\">Vagrant</a> to setup a multi-machine private network with static IPs.</p><p>Getting the machines setup was much easier than I expected, and then getting SolrCloud working wasn't much more complicated. However, there does appear to be a lack of good examples of exactly how to get something like this going, so in this blog post I'm going to take you through the steps to do just that.</p><h2>Designing the setup</h2><p>A SolrCloud setup has two types of component:</p><p></p><ol><li>One or more <a href=\\\\\\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\\\\\\">Apache Zookeeper</a> instances to manage the distribution of data across the Solr cloud, and the configuration and administration of the Solr nodes.</li><li>One or more Solr nodes on which to store your data and perform your queries.</li></ol><p>The 'Cloud' part of SolrCloud comes from the fact that any data you push into your set of Solr nodes can be split into shards and distributed across the nodes. Each shard is then replicated one or more times on different nodes to provide redundancy.\\\\u00a0</p><p>The amount of shards into which the data is split, and the amount of replicas for each shard is set at the point of creating a collection (more about this later).</p><p></p><p>You can find a basic introduction to how SolrCloud <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/How+SolrCloud+Works\\\\\\">works on the Solr wiki</a>. For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you are aware of the basics.</p><p>My aim for this test is to have each element of the SolrCloud setup running on its own machine. My setup will have three Solr nodes with which I can store and query the data, and a single Zookeeper instance to manage the nodes. You could have multiple Zookeeper instance to provide further redundancy. This would be called a <a href=\\\\\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Setting+Up+an+External+ZooKeeper+Ensemble\\\\\\">Zookeeper ensemble</a>. However, for this initial test we're going to stick with just the one.</p><p>Having three Solr nodes means that I can split my data into two shards with two replicas of each, and if one of the Solr nodes goes down I'll still be able to access all of the data.</p><h2>Setting up the machines</h2><p>I'm building my test network using Ubuntu virtual machines.
